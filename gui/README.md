[Cozy][0] Desktop GUI <sup>(alpha)</sup>
========================================

The Cozy desktop app allows to sync the files stored in your Cozy with your
laptop and/or your desktop. It replicates your files on your hard drive and
apply changes you made on them on other synced devices and on your online Cozy.

**Note**: this is currently a **beta** for Linux. We plan to add support for
OSX and Windows in the coming weeks. Stay tuned!

:warning: **Backup your data before playing with cozy-desktop!**

This directory is for the graphical interface of cozy-desktop, built with
[Electron][8] and [Elm][9].


## Install

Follow the instructions on https://docs.cozy.io/en/mobile/desktop.html


## FAQ

If you have an error that looks like this:

> [Error: Error: /tmp/.org.chromium.Chromium.ox2yyn: failed to map segment from shared object: Operation not permitted: unable to import leveldown]

It means that Cozy-desktop can't run correctly because the temporary directory
is mounted with the `noexec` option and that prevents loading dynamic library
like leveldown from there. The work-around is to use another temp directory:

```bash
$ export TMPDIR="$HOME/tmp"
$ mkdir -p $TMPDIR
$ cozy-desktop
```


## Limitations

Cozy-desktop is designed to synchronize files and folders between a remote
cozy instance and a local hard drive, for a personal usage. We tried to make
it simple and easy. So, it has some limitations:

- Files and folders named like this are ignored:
  - `.system-tmp-cozy-drive` (they are used to keep internal state)
  - `_design` (special meaning for pouchdb/couchdb)

- It's not a particularly good idea to share code with cozy-desktop:
  - `node_modules` have tons of small files
  - compiled code often has to be recompile to works on another environment
  - git and other VCS are not meant to be share like this. You may lose your
    work if you make changes on two laptops synchronized by cozy-desktop (it's
    the same with [dropbox][1], [google-drive][2], [syncthing][3], etc.)

- If the same file has been modified in parallel, cozy-desktop don't try to
  merge the modifications. It will just rename of one the copies with a
  `-conflict` suffix. It's the same for folders.

- We expect a personal usage:
  - a reasonable number of files and folders (< 1.000.000)
  - a reasonable number of files per folder (< 10.000)
  - a reasonable size for files (< 1 To)
  - a reasonable size for files and folders path (< 1024 bytes)
  - not too many changes
  - etc.

- For OSX, filenames with weird unicode characters may be problematic in some
  rare cases.

- Symbolic links and ACL are not yet handled.

- The full sync directory must be on the same partition.

- Large files must be uploaded/downloaded in one time (we are thinking about
  making it possible to split a large file in several blocks for
  download/upload).

- Due to its nature, cozy-desktop needs resources:
  - CPU, for checksums in particular
  - RAM, to keep all the metadata in memory, and for nodejs libraries
  - Disk, but the overhead from cozy-desktop is low
  - Network bandwidth obviously

- No advanced feature, like P2P replication between several cozy-desktop
  instances.


## Hack

First, you need to build cozy-desktop in the parent directory with `npm run
build`.

Electron is based on node 6 and npm 3. So, it's better to install the
`node_modules` in `gui` with a node 6 and npm 3:

```sh
cd gui
npm install -g node-gyp
npm install
npm run build
```

Then, you launch the GUI with `npm run start`.

You have also `npm run watch` that will run the lint on JS files and compile
the Elm and Stylus stuff when a change is made.

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter the following error: "Error: cannot find module 'cozy-desktop'", make sure that:
* you ran `npm run build` in the cozy-desktop folder
* `rm -rf cozy-desktop/gui/node_modules`
* `npm install && npm run build`
