# Known Issues

Please report any other issue you may encounter by using the app help form.

## Synchronization

**Known issues** that should be fixed in upcoming releases:

* Trashing, restoring and deleting content permanently may not work as expected
  yet, especially regarding shared folders and connectors.
  [details](https://trello.com/c/6jfO4hoB)
* Changing only the case or encoding in a file or directory name, e.g. renaming
  *my stuff* to *MY STUFF*, won't be synchronized on other devices.
  [details](https://trello.com/c/Phc3lLEr)
* Symlinks are not supported yet. Symlinks inside the synchronized directory
  will trigger errors and their content won't be synchronized.
* Using a mount point as the synchronized folder can have unexpected
  consequences: in case it is not mounted when the client starts, the directory
  will appear empty, the client will assume you deleted everything and will
  update your Cozy accordingly, putting everything in the Cozy trash.

**Issues** caused by lower-level bugs that will be **harder to fix or circumvent**:

* Replacing a directory with a file of the same name won't work (same when
  replacing a file with a directory of the same name).
  [details](https://trello.com/c/rBQ2XXwp)
* When moving 2 directories at the same time on Windows, possibly only 1 move
  may be detected. [details](https://trello.com/c/X3QMUQO3)


## Performances & resources consumption

* The app takes some time before actually syncing, may hold on until
  there is no more activity, and uses a lot of CPU on start and when syncing.
  [details](https://trello.com/c/IQEImXQF)
* Actions involving lots of content may take too much time to complete or use
  too much resources. But adding 100000 files or moving 50000 files should
  still work. [details](https://trello.com/c/IQEImXQF)
* Logs can grow up a lot. We want to reduce the default verbosity, but it
  currently helps us a lot with synchronisation issues.

## UI issues

* The *Start Cozy Drive on system startup* switch in the app settings may not
  reflect the actual configuration. This is an UI bug, the app should still be
  effectively started on boot.

## Windows specific issues

* In case the app shows a white window, this *may* have something to do with the
  GPU settings. See [related electron issue](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/4380).

## macOS integration

* The systray icon/menu doesn't behave exactly the same as native ones: missing
  background color when selected, clicking on nearby icon doesn't hide the
  popover...
* Right-click menu doesn't work, so there is no obvious way to quit
  (workaround: you can show the help form and then quit via menu or Cmd+Q).
* Clicking on the systray icon may bring you to the last *space* were it was
  open.
* The popover is still moveable with tools like BetterTouchTools.
* When opening the local synced folder, the Finder windows shows up in the
  background.

## GNU/Linux integration

* If the `*.AppImage` file is moved after first run, then the desktop shortcut
  will always launch the old app version, even after auto-updating
  (**workaround**: install the *appimaged* daemon as explained in the
  [linux install doc](https://github.com/cozy-labs/cozy-desktop/blob/master/doc/usage/linux.md#install)).
* The icon is broken with alt+tab or in the GNOME 3 application menu.
* The app takes far more time to start.
* Without an extension like TopIcons-Plus on GNOME 3, the systray icon is not
  visible, leaving no other way to access the popover (since we don't bring it
  up when relaunching the app yet). It should work on other GNU/Linux desktops
  with systray support though.
* Sometimes the systray icon is not visible on Debian Jessie, although the
  popover still works. Please fill separate issues for other distros.
  [details](https://github.com/cozy-labs/cozy-desktop/issues/422)
* The popover is not aligned with the systray icon.
* The popover may appear on the wrong place with multiple screens.
* The auto-hiding of the popover makes it almost unusable with tiling window
  managers. [details](https://github.com/cozy-labs/cozy-desktop/issues/892)
