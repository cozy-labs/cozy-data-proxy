Tests
=====

Dependencies
------------

Dependencies are managed with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), so you'll
have to [install it](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) first.

Then, to install dev dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

We use [`mocha`][1] for testing cozy-desktop, the options are in
[`test/mocha.opt`][2].

Integration tests and some unit tests require that you have a Cozy stack up.
It's also expected that you have an instance registered for
`test.cozy-desktop.tools:8080` with the
[test passphrase](../test/helpers/passphrase.js).

Unit tests
----------

For testing a class in isolation, method per method:

```bash
yarn test-unit
```


Integration tests
-----------------

:warning: **Important**: the integration tests remove all the files and folders
on the Cozy! We recommend using the default repository with
`COZY_DESKTOP_DIR=tmp`.

You can run the integration suite to test the communication between
cozy-desktop and a remote cozy stack:

```bash
COZY_DESKTOP_DIR=tmp yarn test-integration
```


Scenarios
---------

Recently we have been writing more and more scenarios as plain data in
`./cli/test/scenarios/*/scenario.js` files. Those can then be used to *capture*
local and/or remote events generated by those scenarios actions (by running the
`yarn capture` script from the `./cli/` directory, see `yarn capture -- --help`
for more information). The captured events are stored in the corresponding
`./cli/test/scenarios/*/{local|remote}/` subdirectory. Finally we can use those
captures as fixtures in tests (see `cli/test/integration/scenarios.js`). The
main benefit is that both local and remote events can come in remote order, so
using versioned test input makes the tests repetable/reliable and allows us to
try different event sequences.

- TODO: Refactor `cli/dev/capture*` and `cli/test/helpers/scenarios.js`
- TODO: The local/remote wording is confusing. Use source/target instead?
- TODO: Don't name local captures after the platform since they usually are not
  platform-specific.
- TODO: Use captures instead of real actions when run from the remote side (so
  we can test different event sequences)
- TODO: Use captures when run from the local side with stopped client (so tests
  don't fail randomly)
- TODO: Run scenarios with Cozy offline first, then back
- TODO: Enable and fix the last failing scenarios
- TODO: Eventually stop asserting the whole chain in every scenario to make the
  build faster
- TODO: Eventually check scenario data structure with Flow (so one doesn't
  believe everything is green while nothing is actually tested)
- TODO: Eventually find a way to test a few loop effects

Options
-------

It's possible to launch unit and integration tests:

```bash
COZY_DESKTOP_DIR=tmp yarn test
```

To run a specific set of tests (here testing pouch)

```bash
NODE_ENV=test node_modules/.bin/mocha test/unit/pouch.js
```

For more logs you can activate debug logs:

```bash
DEBUG=true COZY_DESKTOP_DIR=tmp yarn test
```


Coverage
--------

You can enable coverage metrics for any npm command with the
[`coverage.sh`][3] script.

Examples:

```bash
./scripts/coverage.sh yarn test
./scripts/coverage.sh yarn test-unit
```

Please note that code coverage is only measured for unit tests.
Integration tests have another purpose, so they are deliberately excluded,
even when running `./scripts/coverage.sh yarn test-integration`
explicitely.

Please also note that we don't measure coverage on the GUI for now.

Implementation details:

1. `yarn test-unit-coverage` wraps the `mocha` command with
   [nyc][3] to compile the code with [babel-plugin-istanbul][3].
the [appropriate option][3].
2. `babel-plugin-istanbul` inserts instrumentation code when compiling from
   EcmaScript to JavaScript
3. The mocha tests are run and generate an lcov-style report (including
   HTML output)
4. Finally, when run on the CI, we [tell Travis](../.travis.yml) to upload the report to the
   [Codecov][5] service.
