Cozy Drive for Desktop allows you to synchronize the files stored in [your Cozy](https://cozy.io) with your laptop and/or desktop computer.
It replicates your files on your hard drive and applies the changes you make to them on other synchronized devices and on [your online Cozy](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack).

You can download it for Windows, macOS, and Linux on [**Cozy Drive for Desktop download page**](https://cozy.io/en/download/).

The [`cozy-desktop`](https://github.com/cozy-labs/cozy-desktop) repository is where we do development and there are many ways you can participate in the project, for example:

-   [Submit bugs and feature requests](https://github.com/cozy-labs/cozy-desktop/issues) and help us verify as they are checked in.
-   Review [source code changes](https://github.com/cozy-labs/cozy-desktop/pulls).
-   Review the [documentation](https://github.com/cozy-labs/cozy-desktop/tree/master/doc) and make pull requests for anything from typos to new content.
