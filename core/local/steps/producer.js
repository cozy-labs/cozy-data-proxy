// This class is a producer: it watches the filesystem and the events are
// created here.
//
// On Windows:
//   the API used for FS notifications is ReadDirectoryChangesW. It is
//   recursive and works without too many darts. Still, it doesn't detect the
//   moves and atom/watcher can misunderstand renaming with just case swapping
//   (Foo -> foo).
//
//   Another important thing to know is that we need to scan added directories: if
//   the directory was restored from the trash or moved from outside the watched
//   directory, ReadDirectoryChangesW won't send us events for the files and
//   sub-directories.
//
// On Linux:
//   the API used for FS notifications is inotify and is not recursive. It
//   means that we have to add a watcher when we a new directory is added (and to
//   remove a watcher when a watched directory is removed).
//
//   Even if inotify has a IN_ISDIR hint, atom/watcher does not report it. So, we
//   have to call stat on the path to know if it's a file or a directory for add
//   and update events.

  // Atom/watcher has a recursive option, even on Linux. It just calls inotify
  // on each sub-directory. Using this option has some pros and cons:
  //
  // - Pro: we don't have to explicitely manage the inotify watchers on Linux
  // - Pro: move/rename detection is made by atom/watcher on Linux
  // - Con: the sync dir must be scanned twice on Linux, once by atom/watcher
  //   to put the inotify watchers, and once by Producer for the initial scan
  // - Con: when a new directory is detected, we must scan it twice on Linux,
  //   once by atom-watcher to put inotify watchers on sub-directories that can
  //   have been added faster that the event has bubbled, and once by the local
  //   watcher (because it can be a directory that has been moved from outside
  //   the synchronized directory, and atom/watcher doesn't emit events in that
  //   case).
  //
  // As atom/watcher doesn't give use the inotify cookies, the move/rename
  // detection is probably the harder of the four tasks. So, we choosed to use
  // the recursive option.
