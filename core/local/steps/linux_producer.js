// This class is a producer: it watches the filesystem and the events are

//
// On Linux, the API to watch the file system (inotify) is not recursive. It
// means that we have to add a watcher when we a new directory is added (and to
// remove a watcher when a watched directory is removed).
//
// Even if inotify has a IN_ISDIR hint, atom/watcher does not report it. So, we
// have to call stat on the path to know if it's a file or a directory for add
// and update events.

  // Atom/watcher has a recursive option, even on Linux. It just calls inotify
  // on each sub-directory. Using this option has some pros and cons:
  //
  // - Pro: we don't have to explicitely manage the inotify watchers
  // - Pro: move/rename detection is made by atom/watcher
  // - Con: the sync dir must be scanned twice, one by atom/watcher to put the
  //   inotify watches, and the other by LinuxProducer for the initial scan
  // - Con: when a new directory is detected, we must scan it twice, one time
  //   by atom-watcher to put inotify watches on sub-directories that can have
  //   been added faster that the event has bubbled, and one time by the local
  //   watcher (because it can be a directory that has been moved from outside
  //   the synchronized directory, and atom/watcher doesn't emit events in that
  //   case).
  //
  // As atom/watcher doesn't give use the inotify cookies, the move/rename
  // detection is probably the harder of the four tasks. So, we choosed to use
  // the recursive option.
